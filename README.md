### Summary

A web service (HTTP REST API) to work with tournaments.

### Glossary

A *Tournament* is an object consists of max number of participants multiples of 8 (8, 16, 32, etc...) and number of [single-elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament) matches that will be played.

A *Match* is an object consist of two participants, start time, finish time and participant scores.

A *Participant* is an object consist of unique id and unique nickname or even just unique id. The mechanism for creating and storing members is not important. Any options are acceptable from filling in the *java.util.Map* by hand or saving to the database via endpoints.

### Details

Operations to be provided by the web service:

- Creating a tournament.
- Getting a tournament by its identifier.

- Adding participants in tournament.
- Removing participants from tournament while it's on hold.
- Summarizing results in match.
